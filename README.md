# INeedA

An app that will help you find certain places around you, such as ATM’s, Bar’s, Hospitals, etc…   It uses the jQuery mobile framework for display, and the Google places API to find the places.  It then lists address info, and ratings as well as marks places on a map and upon selecting a specific place you will be given a map with directions and a link to easily call that place.  This project is optimized for mobile and desktop using css media queries.
